# Cannon Blast

A Unity 2D arcade game where you control a mobile cannon to defend against falling meteors. Shoot down meteors before they reach the ground, using intuitive mouse controls and fast reflexes.

---

## Project Description

Meteor Defense is a fast-paced, single-player arcade game built in Unity. The player controls a cannon that moves horizontally along the bottom of the screen. Meteors fall from above, and the player must shoot them down before they hit the ground or the cannon itself. The game features dynamic meteor physics, a missile queue system, and visually animated clouds for atmosphere.

- **Missile Shooting**: Fire missiles by holding the left mouse button.
- **Meteor Physics**: Meteors fall, bounce, and interact with the environment.
- **Health System**: Meteors display their health and require multiple hits to destroy.
- **Cloud Animation**: Animated clouds for visual polish.
- **UI**: Health display for meteors using TextMeshPro.
- **Singleton Managers**: Centralized game and missile management.

## How to Play / Controls

- **Move Cannon**: Move your mouse horizontally; the cannon follows the mouse's X position.
- **Shoot Missiles**: Hold the left mouse button (`Mouse0`) to fire missiles upward.
- **Objective**: Destroy meteors before they reach the ground or hit your cannon. If a meteor hits the cannon, the game ends.
